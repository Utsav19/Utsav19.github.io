	<h2>Hi there, I'm Kundan Kumar!</h2>
	<p>I am an aspiring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> researcher currently enrolled in B. Tech. - M. Tech. dual degree at <a href="http://www.iitk.ac.in/">IIT Kanpur</a>.
	Since the first week of June 2016, I am visiting <a href="https://mila.umontreal.ca/en/">MILA,</a> <a href="http://www.umontreal.ca/english/">University of Montreal</a> as an intern. I wish to develop machines capable of perceiving, reasoning and learning as humans do. 
	I visited <a href="http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/">Computer Vision lab, UMASS</a>, Amherst during May-July
	2015 where I worked with <a href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/">Prof. Subhransu Maji</a>
	<a href="/about.html">Read more about my life...</a></p>
	<p>Recently, I have been exploring various projects related to Computer Vision and Machine Learning. 
	I have used deep learning techniques while working on many of the problems and am very excited about it.
	Project report on visual question answering may be found <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~kundan/cs498a/report.pdf">here</a>. I worked on relation extraction 
	using knowledge vectors as a course project. Its report may be found <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~kundan/report_365.pdf">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Earlier this year, my team won Xerox 
	Research Innovation Challenge. The competition blog post lies <a href="https://simplifywork.blogs.xerox.com/2016/02/15/can-machine-learning-prevent-death-in-the-icu/">here</a>.</p>
	
	Details of my academic profile and courses done may be found in my <a href="/cv.pdf">CV</a>.
